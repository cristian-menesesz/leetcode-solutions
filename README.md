# LeetCode Solutions

A personal collection of LeetCode problem solutions implemented in Python, TypeScript and C#.

## About This Repository

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems implemented in different programming languages including Python, TypeScript, C#, and potentially more languages in the future as I continue my journey in algorithmic problem-solving and coding interview preparation. Each solution represents my understanding of the problem and the approach taken to solve it.

**Important Note**: The presence of a problem solution in this repository does not indicate mastery of the underlying concepts. Rather, it reflects that I have studied various approaches, referenced other solutions, and worked to understand the logic and techniques applied. Each implementation here represents a learning milestone in my coding journey.

## Problem Categories

Solutions are organized by difficulty level:
- **Easy**: Fundamental problems focusing on basic algorithms and data structures
- **Medium**: More complex problems requiring deeper algorithmic thinking
- **Hard**: Advanced problems involving sophisticated algorithms and optimization

## Solution Format

Only python files includes:
- Problem statement reference
- Clean, readable code implementation
- Approach explanation
- Time and space complexity analysis

Rest of the languages only contains the equivalent code implementation

## Learning Philosophy

This repository reflects a learning-focused approach where:
- Solutions are studied and understood rather than memorized
- Multiple approaches may be explored for a single problem
- Code is written for clarity and comprehension
- Each problem contributes to building algorithmic intuition

## Getting Started

### Python Solutions
```bash
# Navigate to Python directory
cd python

# Run a specific solution
python3 problem_name.py
```

### TypeScript Solutions
```bash
# Navigate to TypeScript directory
cd typescript

# Compile and run TypeScript file
npx ts-node problem_name.ts

# Or compile to JavaScript first
tsc problem_name.ts
node problem_name.js
```

### C# Solutions
```bash
# Navigate to C# directory
cd csharp

# Compile and run C# file
dotnet run problem_name.cs

# Or compile first
csc problem_name.cs
./problem_name.exe
```
